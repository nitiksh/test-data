Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
But it had no pictures or conversations in it.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
"And what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversation?"

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
When suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet.
