# Introduction to C Programming

Welcome to the world of C programming! C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that has stood the test of time.

## What is C?

C is a **procedural programming language** developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It was designed to be a systems programming language but has proven to be versatile enough for a wide range of applications.

### Key Features of C

1. **Simple and Efficient**: C has a small set of keywords and constructs, making it easy to learn yet powerful
2. **Low-level Access**: Direct access to memory through pointers
3. **Portable**: C programs can run on different platforms with minimal modifications
4. **Fast Execution**: Compiled code runs very efficiently
5. **Rich Library**: Standard library provides many built-in functions

## Why Learn C?

Learning C provides several benefits:

- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern languages (C++, Java, JavaScript) borrowed syntax from C
- **Understanding Computer Architecture**: C helps you understand how computers work at a low level
- **System Programming**: Operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers are often written in C
- **Performance**: C programs are among the fastest

### Hello World Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This simple program demonstrates:

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the standard input/output library
- **`int main()`**: The entry point of every C program
- **`printf()`**: Function to print text to the console
- **`return 0;`**: Indicates successful program execution

## Applications of C

C is used in:

- **Operating Systems**: Linux, Windows, macOS kernels
- **Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers, IoT devices
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Compilers**: GCC, Clang
- **Game Engines**: Unity, Unreal Engine (C/C++)

> **Note**: C is not object-oriented like Java or Python, but it teaches fundamental programming concepts that apply everywhere.

## Getting Started

To write C programs, you'll need:

1. **A Text Editor**: VS Code, Vim, or any code editor
2. **A C Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang
3. **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: To compile and run programs

### Compilation Process

```bash
# Compile the program
gcc hello.c -o hello

# Run the program
./hello
```

Let's begin your journey into C programming!
